# 📈 Customer Clustering in a Retail Market: Data Driven Approaches

## ✏️ Introduction

Master Thesis Research Project exploring different data driven approaches to clustering customers in a retail industry.

Implemented Unsupervised Learning models in Python and visulaized results using Microsoft PowerBI. Based on datasets provided by a confidential and credible source. The datasets included customer shopping and demographic data from two distinct locations of the same grocery retailer based in Rome, Italy.

I performed extensive exploratory data analysis and implemented multiple approaches to clustering to reach conclusive answers to multiple business questions and demands of the retailer. Furthermore, I extracted some of the treated data to PowerBI to create interactive reports and visualizations for better understanding.

See the `Master Thesis.pdf` file for a detailed report of my work or `Master Thesis Presentation.pdf` for a brief summary of my work.

## 📦 Installation

In Python, the following packages are required to run the code:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You should also have some sort of Python environment manager installed, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

You should also have access to Microsoft PowerBI to create your own dashboards and view my results.

## 🎯 Included Clustering Methods:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

And multiple different extensions of these methods using different features.
